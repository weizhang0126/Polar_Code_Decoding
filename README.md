My master's research direction is channel encoding and decoding. Polar Codes is the focus of my research. During my rearsch, I Use Programming Language C to implement Common decoding algorithms such as SC SCL SCF.
Meanwhile my research is that Bit flipping is used in the decoding process to further improve decoding performance. I will continue to update the open source code of my published papers.
